Take the openapi yaml components:

{yaml}

Take the following message:

"{message}"

And try to generate a json for {entity}.

If you identify the payload as some sort of Query or filter object:
     - do NOT include date fields unless clearly specified in the message.
     - do NOT include id fields.

If you identify as other types of payload and not query or filter then check if there is:
     - some sort of id field, use: "user." user id + "." + random uuid
     - some sort of source field, use "chat";
     - some sort of source_id or type field, extract key data from message itself separated by "." and trim the white spaces, and remove special chars
     - some sort of owner or author field, assign: "user." user id;
     - some sort of datetime field, assign today's date timestamp

Do not make any comments.
Just the payload, if you are not able to generate a valid payload, just reply 'nyl'
